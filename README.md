# 🩺 DhanvaCare  
**MedGemma Impact Challenge 2026**

**DhanvaCare** is a **conceptual, design-focused AI healthcare decision-support ecosystem** built using **Google MedGemma (HAI-DEF)** and **HeAR (Health Acoustic Representations)**.  
It is designed to **reduce preventable medical errors caused by miscommunication**—between patients and clinicians, across care teams, and during critical medical handoffs.

Named after *Dhanvantari* as a historical association with medicine, DhanvaCare reflects a design philosophy that combines **trusted medical knowledge with modern, safety-aligned AI** to improve clarity, continuity, and care coordination.

> **TL;DR:** A MedGemma-powered, safety-first healthcare support system focused on reducing misdiagnosis caused by medical miscommunication.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This submission is a **non-clinical, non-diagnostic prototype**. All outputs are illustrative. No real patient data, backend pipelines, or clinical decision logic are included.

# 🌍 **The Problem I Witnessed (Why DhanvaCare Exists)**

I have *personally witnessed multiple deaths and serious medical complications* that occurred not due to negligence, but due to **unintentional misdiagnosis caused by miscommunication**.

* Patients, overwhelmed by pain or anxiety, often miss mentioning subtle symptoms that later turn out to be crucial.

* Doctors and nurses, working under extreme time pressure, may initially interpret symptoms as common conditions.

* During medical handoffs, vital information can be delayed, fragmented, or lost.

None of this is intentional — it is a **systemic human limitation in high-pressure healthcare environments**.

These gaps inspired me to build **DhanvaCare** — *a system that listens better, remembers better, and communicates better* than traditional workflows.

---

# 🚀 **The Solution**

**DhanvaCare** is designed to capture patient information once, structure it intelligently, and reuse it safely across care journeys.

**DhanvaCare** is an AI-assisted, non-diagnostic Clinical Decision Support System designed to:

* Capture structured symptom input

* Interpret symptoms using MedGemma

* Align outputs with clinical safety guardrails

* Generate triage recommendations

* Maintain clinician-in-the-loop oversight

⚠️ The system does NOT provide medical diagnoses.
It supports triage and structured communication.

*Better symptom capture → better clinical reasoning → safer outcomes.*

It *does not replace doctors.*
It supports them, especially when time, clarity, and continuity are at risk.

1️⃣ **AI Diagnosis & Intelligent Triage**

A shared tool for patients, nurses, and doctors

**Multimodal inputs:**

* 📝 Text
* 🎤 Voice (HeAR)
* 📷 Camera (visual symptoms)

* Conversational Q&A-style symptom intake

* AI-generated diagnostic report with:
      * Structured symptom summary
      * Risk triage
      * Probable condition ranges (non-diagnostic)
Nurses or staff can collect complete information before the doctor arrives, making treatment faster and more efficient.

---

**2️⃣ Emergency Response Section 🚑**

Designed for Golden Hour situations

     * Heart attack
     * Stroke
     * Critical emergencies

* One-tap emergency helplines
* Nearby hospitals and emergency centers
* Symptom-triggered escalation logic

---

**3️⃣ Doctors Nearby (Smart Discovery) 🗺️**

* A map-based interface for informed healthcare access

* Discover doctors based on:

    * Rating
    * Fee / affordability
    * Specialty
    * Distance & availability

* Especially useful for:

    * Migrants (students & professionals)
    * People new to a city
    * Emergency situations

  ---

  **4️⃣ Online Consultation 💻**

* Healthcare without physical barriers
* Designed for:

    * Physically handicapped individuals
    * Elderly patients
    * Busy professionals

* AI-generated pre-consult summaries
* Saves time for both patient and doctor

---

**5️⃣ Med Record (Secure Med-Vault) 🛡️**

* Continuity of care when time is critical
* Centralized medical history
* Instantly shareable during emergencies
* Prevents delays caused by searching old reports
* Built with privacy, consent, and security as core principles

---

**6️⃣ AI Animation & Visualization 🎥**

* Understanding before consent

* AI-generated animated videos explaining:

     * What happened in the body
     * Disease progression
     * Treatment or surgery necessity

* Used by:
     * *Patients → clarity & reduced fear*
     * *Doctors → better communication & informed consent*

# 📓 Backend Intelligence [Kaggle Notebook (Core AI Logic)]

The primary MedGemma-based reasoning and prompt design are demonstrated in a Kaggle notebook submitted as part of the Google MedGemma Impact Challenge 2026.

🔗 **Kaggle Notebook:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/trishadayanand/dhanvacare-ai-powered-symptom-triage-assistant

Due to ethical, deployment, and security considerations, live model inference is not connected to the frontend. All AI reasoning is transparently demonstrated in the notebook.
