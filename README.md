# DhanvaCare  The GOOGLE MedGemma Impact Challenge 2026

AI-powered medical diagnosis ecosystem using Google MedGemma and HeAR. Designed to eliminate misdiagnosis .

# 🩺 **DhanvaCare**

Eliminating Medical Miscommunication through Multimodal AI

* **DhanvaCare** is an AI-powered medical diagnosis and care-navigation ecosystem designed to reduce preventable medical errors caused by miscommunication—between patients and doctors, between medical practitioners, and during critical medical handoffs.

* Powered by **Google’s MedGemma (HAI-DEF)** and **HeAR (Health Acoustic Representations) foundation models**, DhanvaCare acts as a **Smart Clinical Bridge** that ensures no critical symptom, context, or medical history is lost when it matters most.

# 🌍 **The Problem I Witnessed (Why DhanvaCare Exists)**

I have *personally witnessed multiple deaths and serious medical complications* that occurred not due to negligence, but due to **unintentional misdiagnosis caused by miscommunication**.

* Patients, overwhelmed by pain or anxiety, often miss mentioning subtle symptoms that later turn out to be crucial.

* Doctors and nurses, working under extreme time pressure, may initially interpret symptoms as common conditions.

* During medical handoffs, vital information can be delayed, fragmented, or lost.

None of this is intentional — it is a **systemic human limitation in high-pressure healthcare environments**.

These gaps inspired me to build **DhanvaCare** — **a system that listens better, remembers better, and communicates better* than traditional workflows.

# 🚀 **The Vision**

DhanvaCare is designed to capture patient information once, structure it intelligently, and reuse it safely across care journeys.

*Better symptom capture → better clinical reasoning → safer outcomes.*

It *does not replace doctors.*
It supports them, especially when time, clarity, and continuity are at risk.

# **🧬 About the Developer**

I am **Trisha D**, a *first-semester Computer Science & Engineering student* at **Sir MVIT, Bengaluru, India**, with a strong background in Biology from my Pre University College.
**DhanvaCare** is my submission for the **2026 MedGemma Impact Challenge**, built from *real-world observations* and a *desire to make healthcare safer through responsible AI.*

---

# **❤️ Closing Note**

**DhanvaCare** was born not from theory, but from **witnessing how small communication gaps can cost lives.*
This project is my attempt to reduce those gaps — with empathy, technology, and responsibility.

Developed with ❤️ to make healthcare safer, clearer, and more human.

# Oath Of Thanks

* I extend sincere grattitude to the researchers and engineers whose work in responsible medical AI, particularly through MedGemma and HeAR, has made it possible to pursue safer clinical decision support. This project is both a learning journey and a responsibility; I remain committed to building DhanvaCare with humility, ethical rigor, and empathy, always mindful that technology in healthcare must serve human judgment, preserve dignity, and ultimately protect life.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
With warm regards,
